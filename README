This is a simulation of an economy that will start off relatively simple, but will eventually get more complex, with stocks and everything, alongside a LATER integration with a grid based environment (maybe, you could of course abstract geographical distance on a grid based environment to a weighted edge graph).
In its current rendition, the goal is to have a heterogenous set of traders interact with each other of a graph network, and also have them be able to add to their connections or sever other connections.
Another goal is to have it run in MESA, but of course, they don't have a graph module!
